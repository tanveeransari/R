# Linear regression - basic assumptions -- see original content slides on
# Model Checking and model selection
#     Variance is constant
#     You are summarizing a linear trend
#     You have all the right terms in the model
#     There are no big outliers

#Conditions restated from other course
# 1) Linear relationship  - Plot residuals of e vs x (not y vs x) where e is residuals
# 2) Nearly normally distributed residuals - Can check by making histogram or a normal probability plot(qqnorm and qqline)
# 3) Constant variability of residuals. Make plot of residuals vs predicted (yhat) [Not residuals vs x]
# 4) Independent residuals . Just plot residuals without any x axis
